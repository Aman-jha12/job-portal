# Job Portal API

This is the complete backend service for a modern job portal application. It's built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient.

This API handles all the core logic for a multi-user system, including:

- **Three User Roles:** `APPLICANT`, `RECRUITER`, and `ADMIN`.
- **Secure Authentication:** User registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Job & Company Management:** Full CRUD operations for recruiters to post jobs and manage company profiles.
- **Application System:** Applicants can upload their resumes (via AWS S3) and apply for jobs.
- **Background Notifications:** Uses a Redis queue to handle notifications efficiently without slowing down the API.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Special endpoints for admins to manage users, companies, and all platform data.

## üß† Technologies Used

This project uses a modern, type-safe, and scalable tech stack. Here's a look at the core technologies and *why* they were chosen.

- **Node.js & Express:** The foundation of the server. Express is a minimal and flexible framework that lets us build our API quickly and logically.
- **TypeScript:** This adds static typing to JavaScript. It helps us catch bugs *before* we even run the code, making the entire application more robust and easier to maintain.
- **Prisma:** A next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). It makes talking to our database incredibly simple and type-safe. We write our schema, and Prisma generates a complete database client for us.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful and reliable open-source SQL database. It's perfect for handling the complex relationships between users, companies, jobs, and applications.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT) & bcrypt.js:** The core of our security.
  - **bcrypt.js:** We use this to hash and salt user passwords. This means we *never* store plain-text passwords in our database.
  - **jsonwebtoken:** We use this to create secure "access tokens" for users when they log in. These tokens are sent with every protected request to prove who they are.
- **Multer & AWS S3:** This is our file-handling solution.
  - **Multer:** A middleware that processes `form-data` (file uploads) in Express.
  - **AWS S3:** A cloud storage service. We don't store files (like resumes or profile pictures) on our server; we upload them directly to an S3 bucket. This is more scalable, secure, and reliable.
- **Redis & Bull:** Our high-performance background job system.
  - **Redis:** An in-memory data store, used here as a message broker.
  - **Bull:** A robust queue library built on Redis. When a user applies for a job, we don't want to make them wait while our server creates a notification. We instantly add a "notification job" to the Bull queue. A separate worker process (powered by Redis) picks up this job and handles it in the background, so the user gets an instant response.
- **Docker:** We use Docker to run our Redis database in a predictable, isolated container. This means you don't need to manually install and configure Redis on your machine; you just run one command.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (to run Redis)
- A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database
- An [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with access keys

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-portal.git
cd job-portal
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

This is the most important step. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if you have one) or use the template below and fill in your own values.

```
# .env

# 1. Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME"

# 2. Authentication
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_STRONG_SECRET_KEY_HERE"

# 3. AWS S3 for File Uploads
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket-name"
AWS_S3_REGION="your-s3-region"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key"

# 4. Redis (for Queues)
REDIS_HOST="127.0.0.1"
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=""
```

### 4. Start Your Redis Container

Run this command in your terminal. This will download the official Redis image and start a container named `my-job-portal-redis` on port `6379`.

```bash
docker run -d --name my-job-portal-redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

You can leave this running in the background.

### 5. Run Database Migrations

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

---

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server will run at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

### Other Useful Scripts

* **Build for Production:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
* **Run in Production:**

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
* **Open Prisma Studio:**

  ```bash
  npm run prisma:studio
  ```
* **Run the Seed Script:**

  ```bash
  npm run seed
  ```

## üë• Project Workflow & User Roles

This API has three distinct user roles with different permissions.

### 1. APPLICANT (Default)

* Registers via `/auth/register`
* **Can:** View jobs, view companies, apply for jobs, manage own applications, bookmark jobs, edit profile.
* **Cannot:** Post jobs or manage other users.

### 2. RECRUITER

* Promoted by an admin.
* **Can:** Do everything an Applicant can, plus:

  * Create and manage their own company profile.
  * Post jobs for their company.
  * View/manage applications for their jobs.
* **Cannot:** Manage other companies or users.

### 3. ADMIN

* Created via seed script or manually in DB.
* **Can:** Do everything, including:

  * Manage all users, companies, and jobs.
  * Promote/demote users (e.g. `APPLICANT` ‚Üí `RECRUITER`).
  * Delete any user, job, or company.
